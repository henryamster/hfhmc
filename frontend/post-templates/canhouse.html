        <h2>CANS FOR HABITAT</h2>
        <p class="has-text-primary">Cans for Habitat is a partnership between The Aluminum Association and Habitat for Humanity International that promotes the value of aluminum can recycling. Households in Madison and Clark Counties collect and donate their aluminum cans which
            are recycled by Novelis. EKU collects and donates all aluminum cans on campus to Habitat as and with their help 9,780 lbs of aluminum cans were recycled from across Madison and Clark Counties. Cans are recycled in Berea at Novelis and proceeds
            are then donated to Habitat!</p>
        <p class="has-text-black">If you have spare aluminum cans, there are various "Can House" locations throughout Madison Count where you can drop them off.</p>
