    <div class=" column is-6"><strong>ReStore</strong> is a retail outlet where donated building materials and a variety of home improvement merchandise are sold at 30-75% below retail prices. The ReStore supports the mission of Habitat for Humanity by generating revenue to build
        and renovate Habitat homes in Madison &amp; Clark Counties. ReStore’s inventory, which includes new and used items, comes from builders, retailers, distributors, and individuals who donate everything from building supplies and materials to light
        fixtures and furniture. When businesses and individuals donate reusable goods to Habitat ReStores, these materials end up as part of remodeling, home improvement and decorating projects instead of in landfills.</div>

        <h3>ReStore Builds Habitat Homes</h3>
        By shopping, donating, and volunteering at your Habitat ReStore you build strength, stability, and self reliance through shelter with families in your community. Volunteers and donors work together at ReStore selling gently loved household items and like

        The Habitat ReStore also sells recycled latex paint that is remixed, tinted, and made good as new. Feel good about knowing that the paint that you are using was not only kept out of landfills but also helps build local, affordable housing. You support
        this environmentally friendly program when you donate your used latex paint and purchase your paint from ReStore!
